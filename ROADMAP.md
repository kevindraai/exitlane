# Roadmap

The roadmap describes direction rather than a release commitment. Priorities may change as the
beta is tested in real networks.

## Completed in v0.2.0-beta.5

- Restored the complete pre-merge review and final-main release-assurance chain.
- Required the existing CI, CodeQL, supply-chain and ZAP checks for `main`.
- Added automatic CodeQL validation on pushes to `main` and policy-level Action SHA enforcement.
- Added clean-install qualification for the supported Debian 13 `amd64` appliance baseline.

Beta.5 inherits the beta.4 UX, accessibility, design-system and integrated-documentation baseline.

## Completed in v0.2.0-beta.4

- Cobalt / Slate design-system adoption and bounded UX/accessibility polish.
- Integrated authenticated documentation and contextual help links.

## Completed in v0.2.0-beta.1

- Encrypted, authenticated appliance backup
- Strictly validated root-only restore with session revocation
- Explicit monotonic database schema versioning
- Locked alpha-to-beta upgrade with a pre-upgrade recovery snapshot
- Automatic data, code, configuration, and systemd-unit rollback on installer failure
- Internal security-assurance matrix for lifecycle and existing application boundaries

## Completed foundations in v0.2.0-beta.2 and beta.3

- Provider-neutral VPN registry, navigation, status and capability boundaries
